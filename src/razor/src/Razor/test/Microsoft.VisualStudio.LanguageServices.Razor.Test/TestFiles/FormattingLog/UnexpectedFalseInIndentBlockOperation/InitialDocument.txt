They also required real-time communication (for live ride tracking) and a slick, user-friendly UI to instill confidence in users. As a small startup, they had to deliver all this with limited time and budget."]</p>

This decision immediately cut development time and cost in half, since one codebase produces two native apps. \"With .NET MAUI, we were able to share over 90% of our code across platforms. That efficiency let us move faster, reduce maintenance overhead, and deliver a consistent experience on both iOS and Android.\", Mario adds. The .NET MAUI framework provided the native performance and flexibility needed, without requiring a large team. Key aspects of the solution include:"]</p>
                <ul class="ul-list pl-5 my-4">
                    <li class="my-4 body-1">@T["<b>Unified App Codebase:</b> ~90% of the Doggie Bus app code is shared across platforms. Core features (UI layouts, ride logic, data models) were written once in .NET and run natively on both iOS and Android. Only a few parts required platform-specific tweaks (for example, a custom map renderer on each OS to smoothly animate the little bus icon). This single-codebase approach ensures feature parity and simplified maintenance."]</li>
                    <li class="my-4 body-1">@T["<b>Azure-Powered Backend:</b> The team built a cloud backend with ASP.NET Core and Azure to handle authentication, scheduling, and data storage. Using Azure SignalR, the app achieves real-time updates: as Troy drives, the van's GPS location is sent to the cloud and instantly pushed to pet owners' phones, so they see the bus moving live on the map. All data (schedules, pet profiles, vaccination records) is stored in Azure SQL Database via Entity Framework. The backend also integrates with Apple and Google for easy sign-in. This end-to-end Microsoft stack (MAUI app + Azure services) ensures reliability and scalability from day one."]</li>
                    <li class="my-4 body-1">@T["<b>Modern Dev Tools & Libraries:</b> Mario leveraged the rich .NET ecosystem to accelerate development. He used the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit for ready-made UI components and effects and tapped into open-source libraries for things like authentication flows. Productivity features like XAML Hot Reload allowed rapid UI tweaks, and GitHub Copilot acted as an AI pair-programmer, generating boilerplate code and speeding up development. The result: Doggie Bus went from concept to feature-rich, polished app in a fraction of the time compared to traditional multi-team development."]</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="my-4 body-1">@T["Why .NET MAUI? Aside from cross-platform efficiency, Doggie Bus chose .NET for its performance and unified ecosystem. The app uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, so it runs with \"buttery smooth\" performance even on older Android phones. By using C# on both client and server, the team can share code and skills across the whole project. For example, data models are defined once and reused on both ends, reducing bugs and mismatches."]</p>
                <p class="my-4 body-1">@T["Mario briefly considered other frameworks, but having delivered successful apps with Xamarin, he trusted .NET MAUI to give native-quality results. \"In my opinion, it's a no-brainer,\" he says about choosing MAUI. This unified approach eliminated hiring separate iOS/Android developers and learning new languages - a huge advantage for a small company. Even challenges like implementing real-time maps and social login were solved smoothly with .NET's flexibility and libraries."]</p>
                <p class="body-1">@T["Whenever a hurdle arose (like fine-tuning the moving map pin animation), .NET allowed custom solutions without hitting a dead end.

Booking a ride now takes just seconds in the app, replacing what used to be phone calls or texts. With a couple of taps, a pet owner schedules a pickup - no paperwork or back-and-forth needed. The app sends automatic notifications at key moments (when the bus is approaching, when your dog is picked up, and when drop-off is complete), so owners never worry or wonder."]</p>

Many clients now book Doggie Bus rides multiple times a week as part of their routine, confident that it's dependable and safe for their pups."]</p>

They're also planning a web portal for bookings (likely built with Blazor WebAssembly), and much of the existing .NET code can be reused for it. With .NET, expansion is built-in, not an afterthought - the platform's versatility means mobile, web, and future platforms can all share one codebase and skillset."]</p>
